    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p class="Bio">Ali Gatie was born to Iraqi parents in Yemen in 1997. His family moved to Abu Dhabi before settling in Mississauga, Ontario. 
    He grew up listening to Ed Sheeran, J. Cole and Frank Ocean, who influenced his music. Gatie, who is managed by Sal&CO since May 
    2020 started pursuing a music career at the age of 18 and started to record in 2016. This decision later caused him to drop out 
    of university. In 2017, he won an online RhymeStars competition hosted by Joe Budden. After releasing a string of singles in 2018, 
    he was signed by Warner Records. The song "Moonlight" would turn out to be his first commercial success, garnering nearly 14 mil
    views on YouTube. However, the release of "It's You" in June 2019 would become his mainstream breakthrough; an "explosive streaming 
    story," as of December 2019, it had exceeded 650 million streams.On 8 November 2019, Gatie released his first album, You. A 12-minute 
    film accompanied the release, which included seven new songs. Gatie's snippet of his next single "What If I Told You That I Love You," 
    released on the video-sharing social networking app TikTok, went viral, amassing over 20 million engagements. Released in January 2020, 
    the single was described by Rolling Stone as "a breezy, springtime-fresh midtempo track" and peaked at number 36 on Billboard's Hot 
    Canadian Digital Song Sales Chart.</p>
